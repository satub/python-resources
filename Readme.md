#### My personal repository for good Python resources

This list is work in progress, I'll add to it as I go. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of everything available, if you are looking for something like that, check [wiki.python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers) and the [official page for python](https://www.python.org).  

I will also add short code snippets to this repo for noting down some basic syntax. As I am transferring to Python from Ruby, some of these snippets will contain code written in both languages to better grasp the syntax differences.

Some of the code snippets will be written in python 2.7.x, some in python 3.x. To learn more about the difference between versions 2 and 3, [see here](https://www.quora.com/As-someone-interested-in-learning-Python-should-I-start-with-2-x-or-go-straight-to-3-x/answers/2220200?srid=hFhk&share=1) and [the wiki page linked](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3). Quite a few guides are still written in python 2 and most macs come with that version installed. However, python 3 is the recommended version to use. If you want to add python 3 to your Mac straight from your command line, [see instructions here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/).

##### Python basics and getting started    

*  [HackerRank Python   introduction](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python/py-introduction)

    Note: This HackerRank track has good exercises to practice python basics. However, the associated tutorials are often very brief, so reference material is needed for syntax and concepts.   

*  [Google Developers' Python Course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)

    This course comes with coding exercises and video material. The exercises are currently written in python 2. Has also a nice intro on how to set up python on your machine for mac/win/linux plus some text editor caveats.


##### Interesting libraries, repos, python tools

*  [Ren'Py for visual novels](https://www.renpy.org/)
