#### My personal repository for good Python resources

This list is work in progress, I'll add to it as I go. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of everything available, if you are looking for something like that, check [wiki.python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers) and the [official page for python](https://www.python.org).  

I will also add short code snippets to this repo for noting down some basic syntax. As I am transferring to Python from ruby, some of these snippets will contain the same code functionality written in Ruby. This is to better grasp the syntax differences between these two languages.

##### Python basics and getting started    

*  [HackerRank Python   introduction](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python/py-introduction)

    Note: This HackerRank track has good exercises to practice python basics. However, the associated tutorials are often very brief, so reference material is needed for syntax and concepts.   

*  [Google Developers' Python Course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) (comes with coding exercises)  


##### Interesting libraries, repos, python tools

*  [Ren'Py for visual novels](https://www.renpy.org/)
